# Noumead üèùÔ∏è (WIP)

I always forget the number of arguments to pass to a Nomad parameterized job. This CLI allow to dispatch a parameterized job to Nomad and follow the log of the dispatched parameterized job.

## Usage

For the time being, no release has been done. In order to run the CLI please clone this repo and run one of the following command. By default Noumead will look for the `NOMAD_ADDR` & `NOMAD_TOKEN` environment variable

### Only dispatch

```sh
cargo run --  dispatch
```

### Dispatch and follow

```sh
cargo run --  dispatch --follow
```

### Passing var

You can pass the nomad server address & token with this command

```sh
cargo run -- --nomad-url="<url>" --token="<token>" dispatch --follow
```

### Example

Below is an example of the output of Noumead

```sh
> Select the job that you want to dispatch busybox
> Input the required value for: word foo
Job dispatch with name: busybox/dispatch-1672492297-12e99aa9
> Select the task to log test
foo
foo lala
Dispatching done
```

### Stop a job

Sometimes I also dispatch jobs with wrong parameters. As such it's also handy to delete multiple job with a single command line

```sh
cargo run -- --nomad-url="http://127.0.0.1:4646" stop
```
